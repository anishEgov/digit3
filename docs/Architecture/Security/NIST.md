# Introduction to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

## What is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework?

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in collaboration with industry, academia, and government stakeholders. It provides a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity threats and is widely adopted across sectors to improve organizational security.

The framework is voluntary, technology-neutral, and adaptable, making it suitable for organizations of all sizes and maturity levels.

## Framework Structure

The NIST CSF consists of three main components:

### 1. Framework Core

The core provides a set of desired cybersecurity outcomes, organized into Functions, Categories, and Subcategories.

#### The Five Core Functions:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Identify | Develop an understanding of the environment to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities. |
| Protect | Develop and implement safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical services. |
| Detect | Develop and implement activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event. |
| Respond | Take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident. |
| Recover | Maintain plans for resilience and restore capabilities or services impaired due to cybersecurity incidents. |

Each function includes:
* Categories (e.g., Asset Management, Access Control)
* Subcategories (e.g., "Physical devices are inventoried")
* Informative References (e.g., NIST SP 800-53, ISO/IEC 27001)

### 2. Implementation Tiers

Tiers help organizations understand the maturity of their cybersecurity risk management practices. These are not strict maturity levels but provide context for improvement.

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Tier 1: Partial | Cybersecurity risk management is ad hoc and reactive. Limited awareness of risks. |
| Tier 2: Risk Informed | Risk management practices are approved and partially implemented. |
| Tier 3: Repeatable | Formal policies and procedures exist. Cybersecurity practices are regularly updated. |
| Tier 4: Adaptive | Cybersecurity practices are agile, continuously improved, and informed by lessons learned. |

### 3. Framework Profiles

A Profile is a representation of an organization's cybersecurity requirements, risk tolerance, and resources, aligned with the Framework Core.
* Current Profile – The organization's current cybersecurity state.
* Target Profile – The desired cybersecurity state based on business needs and risk tolerance.
* Gap Analysis – Used to identify steps needed to move from the current to the target profile.

## What's New in NIST CSF 2.0 (2024 Update)

Originally released in 2014 and updated in 2018 (v1.1), the NIST CSF was updated again in 2024 with version 2.0, introducing significant improvements.

### Key Enhancements
* Govern Function: A new sixth function to emphasize governance, roles, policies, and oversight.
* Broader Scope: No longer limited to critical infrastructure. Applicable to all organizations.
* Improved Guidance: Offers more practical implementation advice and sector-specific tailoring.
* Supply Chain Security: Stronger emphasis on managing risks across third-party vendors.
* Risk Management Integration: Enhanced alignment with enterprise risk management practices.

## Applying the NIST CSF in Your Organization

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. Set the Scope
   - Define the systems, processes, or departments the framework will apply to.
2. Create a Current Profile
   - Assess existing cybersecurity practices based on the Framework Core.
3. Develop a Target Profile
   - Define desired cybersecurity outcomes based on strategic objectives.
4. Conduct a Gap Analysis
   - Identify gaps between the current and target states.
5. Implement an Action Plan
   - Prioritize initiatives, allocate resources, and begin improvements.
6. Monitor and Evolve
   - Regularly review progress and adjust the framework as needed.

## Benefits of the NIST CSF
* Provides a structured approach to risk management.
* Enhances communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
* Supports compliance with regulatory and industry standards (e.g., ISO, HIPAA, GDPR).
* Facilitates continuous improvement.
* Scales to fit both small businesses and large enterprises.
