**Security and Privacy Staards for Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI): A Strategic Guide for Governments**

---

### Objective of This Document

This document is **not intended to be a comprehensive manual**, but rather to provide a **high-level structure** and mental model to help government security teams think holistically and systematically about **security and privacy** in Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). It aims to align security practices with widely accepted standards, suggest a maturity model for implementation, and clarify the roles and responsibilities of various actors in a DPI ecosystem.

### 1. Understanding Security and Privacy Standards

#### Key Standards

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0)**: A voluntary framework with five core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) designed to help organizations manage cybersecurity risks.
- **NIST SP 800-53 / 800-228**: Catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems; SP 800-228 focuses on securing APIs in cloud-native systems.
- **ISO/IEC 27001**: International standard for establishing and maintaining an Information Security Management System (ISMS).
- **ISO/IEC 27002**: Guidelines for organizational information security controls.
- **ISO/IEC 27701**: Privacy extension to ISO 27001, providing guidance on implementing a Privacy Information Management System (PIMS).
- **UN Universal DPI Safeguards Framework**: Designed specifically for public infrastructure, organized into technical, normative, and organizational safeguards.

#### Relationship Between Standards

- These standards are **complementary**, not mutually exclusive.
- **NIST frameworks** offer detailed operational controls and best practices, suitable for both initial planning and continuous improvement.
- **ISO standards** offer certifiable, globally recognized systems for governance and accountability.
- **UN DPI Framework** is domain-specific, bringing in values like equity, inclusion, and resilience specific to public infrastructure.

#### Mental Model

- **Think of NIST as the “How”**, ISO as the “Proof,” and DPI Safeguards as the “Why.”
- Governments can start with NIST for tactical planning, adopt ISO for formalization and certification, and align outcomes with the DPI framework to ensure trust and inclusion.

### 2. Developing a Comprehensive Security Approach for DPI

Governments should frame their approach to security through the following lenses:

- **Governance**: Establish policies, risk management, accountability structures
- **Engineering**: Secure-by-design development, system hardening, architecture reviews
- **Operations**: Continuous monitoring, incident response, access control
- **Culture**: Promote security awareness across all departments

Leverage standards to:
- Benchmark policies and controls
- Prioritize implementation areas
- Build cross-functional teams
- Assess gaps and create roadmaps

---

### 3. Security Maturity Model (SMM)

#### Levels

- **Level 1 – Foundation**
  - Basic access control, network segmentation, logging
  - Reactive incident response
  - No formal governance structure
- **Level 2 – Structured**
  - Defined policies, role-based access controls
  - Regular audits and vulnerability scans
  - Security roles assigned, limited automation
- **Level 3 – Proactive**
  - Integrated risk management
  - Threat modeling, secure software development lifecycle (SDLC)
  - Automated patching, identity federation
- **Level 4 – Optimized**
  - Continuous threat intelligence and response
  - Full integration of privacy and security engineering
  - Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) tooling and dashboards

#### Assessment Tools
- **Self-assessments** using NIST CSF Implementation Tiers
- **Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing (VAPT)**
- **Third-party audits** aligned to ISO standards
- **Security scorecards** for platform and applications

---

### 4. Path to Certification

- Begin certification pursuits **after reaching Level 2 or 3 maturity**.
- For **ISO/IEC 27001**, ensure:
  - Documented ISMS
  - Risk assessments completed
  - At least one cycle of internal audit and management review
- Engage accredited certification bodies and prepare a pre-assessment if needed

---

### 5. Organizing the Security Team

#### Role-Based Structure per Level

- **Level 1**:
  - IT Administrator
  - Security Focal Point (part-time)

- **Level 2**:
  - Security Officer / Analyst
  - Network / System Security Engineer

- **Level 3**:
  - Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
  - Security Architect
  - DevSecOps / Automation Specialist

- **Level 4**:
  - GRC Lead
  - Threat Intelligence Analyst
  - Privacy Engineer

#### Skill Development
- Ongoing training in cybersecurity (CISSP, CISM), privacy (CIPM), cloud security (CCSP)
- Cross-training between Dev, Ops, and Security

---

### 6. Shared Responsibility Model for DPI

#### Actors and Responsibilities

| Actor                   | Responsibilities                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Platform Provider**  | Core infrastructure security, API gateway, identity federation   |
| **Infra Provider**     | Cloud security, network firewalls, physical security             |
| **Application Teams**  | Secure coding, data privacy, endpoint security                   |
| **Operations Teams**   | Patch management, monitoring, logging, incident response         |
| **Security Team**      | Policy definition, threat intelligence, audits, red-teaming      |

#### Implementation Guidance

- Define and document responsibilities using RACI matrices
- Include shared responsibility clauses in contracts and SLAs
- Conduct periodic tabletop exercises and incident drills
- Use onboarding checklists and training modules for all teams

### 7. Security Across Technical Layers

To think comprehensively about security, teams must apply controls across key technical layers:

| Layer          | Security Considerations                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network**     | Segmentation, firewall rules, VPNs, IDS/IPS, DNS security                               |
| **OS & Host**   | Hardening, secure boot, patching, minimal packages, monitoring                         |
| **Data**        | Encryption at rest/in transit, field-level protection, backups, access audits          |
| **Application** | Secure development lifecycle (SDLC), code scanning, runtime protection                  |
| **Identity**    | Centralized IAM, MFA, RBAC/ABAC, session management                                     |
| **APIs**        | Input validation, rate limiting, authentication/authorization, versioning, schema checks |
| **Monitoring**  | Logging, SIEM integration, anomaly detection, alerting                                 |

These layers are interdependent—weakness at any one point can compromise the whole system. Security must be implemented **end-to-end**, with **layer-specific controls**, tied together through governance and incident response.

**Conclusion**

By grounding practices in well-established frameworks, setting achievable maturity levels, applying security controls across all layers, and clearly distributing responsibilities, governments can establish resilient, inclusive, and trusted digital public infrastructure systems.
