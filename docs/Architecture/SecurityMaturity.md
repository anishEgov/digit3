# Security Maturity Model for Constrained Teams

A level-based Security Maturity Model tailored for teams with constrained capacity, starting from the essentials and scaling up in a realistic, phased manner across:

- Governance
- Operational Practices
- Technical Controls

---

## Level 1: Basic Security Hygiene (Must-Have)

**Goal:** Establish minimum viable security to prevent easy attacks.

### Governance
- Assign a Security Owner (even if part-time)
- Define a simple Acceptable Use & Access Policy
- Track who has access to what (even in a spreadsheet)

### Operations
- Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for admins/devs
- Basic audit logging: access, deployments, API calls
- Perform a basic threat assessment of critical services

### Technical
- Use centralized authentication (e.g., Keycloak, OAuth/OIDC)
- Encrypt data in transit (TLS) and at rest (e.g., disk-level encryption)
- Secrets not in code – store in environment variables or secret managers
- Use read-only file systems for stateless containers

---

## Level 2: Defense in Depth (Hardening + Monitoring)

**Goal:** Strengthen your surface and detect early threats.

### Governance
- Define a Security Policy with roles & responsibilities
- Set up basic incident response playbook (even a shared doc)
- Begin periodic access reviews

### Operations
- Automate patching and updates
- Enable log monitoring and alerts (e.g., failed logins, privilege escalation)
- Use infrastructure-as-code with peer reviews (Terraform, Helm, etc.)

### Technical
- Use HashiCorp Vault or AWS/GCP/Azure Secrets Manager for all secrets
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) in Kubernetes or API gateway
- Use service accounts with limited permissions
- Add basic Web Application Firewall (WAF) or API gateway protection
- Apply CIS Level 1 Benchmarks on operating systems and containers

---

## Level 3: Proactive Security & Privacy-Respecting Architecture

**Goal:** Build security as a foundation, not a patch.

### Governance
- Conduct formal risk assessments and data classification
- Enforce privacy by design in new projects (esp. citizen-facing)
- Introduce security training for devs and admins

### Operations
- Adopt DevSecOps practices – integrate scanning into CI/CD (e.g., Trivy, Snyk)
- Apply network policies, isolate environments by namespace/team
- Regularly test backups and incident response simulation

### Technical
- Enforce least privilege at all layers
- Enable mTLS between services via service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd)
- Add integrity checking (AIDE, etc.)
- Implement revocation support for credentials (VCs, tokens)
- Introduce wallet-based credential flow (OID4VC) for citizen data sharing

---

## Level 4: Advanced – Compliance, Automation, Zero Trust

**Goal:** Enable scalable, automated, policy-driven security.

### Governance
- Adopt a compliance framework (e.g., ISO 27001, DPDP, NIST)
- Define and track security SLAs and KPIs
- Build a security champion program across dev teams

### Operations
- Implement runtime threat detection (Falco, Sysdig)
- Automate CIS Benchmark checks (Lynis, OpenSCAP)
- Monitor resource misconfigurations (e.g., open ports, privilege escalation)

### Technical
- Apply OPA/Gatekeeper or Kyverno to enforce security policies in Kubernetes
- Use immutable infrastructure (no shell access, GitOps)
- Enable anomaly detection via AI/ML (cloud or SIEM tools)
- Enable Selective Disclosure and Zero Knowledge Proofs in VC flows
