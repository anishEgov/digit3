# Interoperable

Ensuring interoperability is crucial for systems to communicate seamlessly, adapt to evolving requirements, and integrate with diverse platforms. By adopting standardized protocols and data formats, organizations can build flexible and future-proof architectures.

## Engineering Practices

- **Build Standards-Based APIs**  
  Design APIs adhering to widely accepted standards like REST or gRPC to ensure compatibility across different systems and platforms.
- **Use Canonical Data Models for Portability**  
  Establish unified data models that serve as a common language between services, facilitating data exchange and reducing transformation overhead.
- **Provide Open API Specifications and SDKs**  
  Publish comprehensive API documentation and offer SDKs in multiple languages to simplify integration for external developers.
- **Implement Versioning Strategies**  
  Manage API changes effectively by versioning endpoints, ensuring backward compatibility and smooth transitions.
- **Adopt Contract-First Development**  
  Define API contracts before implementation, allowing teams to align on interfaces and generate code or mocks from specifications.

## Technology Patterns

- **RESTful APIs**  
  Utilize REST principles to create stateless, scalable, and cacheable web services that are easily consumed by clients.
- **GraphQL**  
  Implement GraphQL for flexible and efficient data retrieval, enabling clients to specify exactly what data they need.
- **OpenAPI / Swagger Definitions**  
  Use OpenAPI specifications to describe RESTful APIs in a machine-readable format, facilitating documentation, testing, and client generation.
- **gRPC with Protocol Buffers**  
  Employ gRPC for high-performance, language-agnostic RPCs, leveraging Protocol Buffers for efficient serialization.
- **Schema Registry**  
  Maintain a centralized repository for data schemas to manage and enforce data contracts across services.
- **API Gateway**  
  Deploy an API gateway to handle request routing, protocol translation, and other cross-cutting concerns, simplifying client interactions.
