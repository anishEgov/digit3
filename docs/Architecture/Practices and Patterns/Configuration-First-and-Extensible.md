# Configuration-First and Extensible

This section outlines the **configuration-driven development approach** that enables business users to define and customize services without coding, while maintaining the flexibility for technical extension through plugins and APIs.

## Engineering Practices

### Configuration Management
- **Declarative Configuration**  
  Define system behavior through configuration files rather than imperative code.
- **Version Control for Configurations**  
  Track and manage configuration changes using version control systems.
- **Configuration Validation**  
  Implement schema validation and testing for configuration files.
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**  
  Support different configurations for development, testing, and production environments.

### Low-Code/No-Code Development
- **Visual Workflow Design**  
  Enable drag-and-drop interface for creating and modifying workflows.
- **Form Builder Tools**  
  Provide intuitive interfaces for creating and managing data collection forms.
- **Rule Engine Configuration**  
  Allow business rules to be defined through configuration rather than code.
- **Template-Based Development**  
  Use pre-built templates for common service patterns.

### Extensibility
- **Plugin Architecture**  
  Support modular extensions through a well-defined plugin system.
- **API-First Design**  
  Ensure all functionality is accessible through well-documented APIs.
- **Custom Component Development**  
  Enable creation of reusable components that can be integrated into the platform.
- **Event-Driven Extensions**  
  Support custom behavior through event hooks and listeners.

## Technology Patterns

| Domain              | Pattern                     | Description                                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Configuration**   | Declarative Configuration   | Define system behavior through configuration files            |
| **Low-Code**        | Visual Development          | Enable drag-and-drop interface for workflow design            |
| **Extensibility**   | Plugin Architecture         | Support modular extensions through plugins                    |
| **Templating**      | Template Systems            | Provide reusable templates for common configurations          |

## Policy & Compliance Considerations

- **Configuration Governance**  
  Establish processes for reviewing and approving configuration changes.
- **Extension Security**  
  Ensure plugins and extensions meet security and compliance requirements.
- **Version Management**  
  Maintain compatibility between core platform and extensions.

## Summary

> By adopting a configuration-first approach with robust extensibility mechanisms, we empower business users to define and customize services while maintaining the flexibility for technical extension, enabling rapid service delivery and continuous innovation.
