# Secure and Privacy-Protective

This section outlines the **end-to-end security architecture**, covering network, data, infrastructure, application, and credential layers to ensure a secure and privacy-respecting environment for citizen-centric service delivery.

## Engineering Practices

### Identity & Access
- **Adopt a Zero Trust model**  
  Every request must be authenticated and authorized, regardless of origin.
- **Role-based and attribute-based access controls**  
  Enforce least privilege using Keycloak roles and external attribute sources.
- **Use short-lived tokens with rotation**  
  Refresh tokens are rotated and revoked on scope change or logout.

### Data Protection
- **Encrypt data in transit**  
  TLS 1.2+ is mandatory for all external and internal service traffic.
- **Encrypt data at rest**  
  Sensitive data (tokens, secrets, PII, VCs) is encrypted using AES-256 or stronger.
- **Token and credential hashing**  
  Use industry-standard password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) and key derivation for VCs.

### Logging & Auditing
- **Audit trails for all key actions**  
  Log authentications, authorization grants, scope approvals, VC issuance & verification.
- **Consent & delegation logging**  
  Record all actions requiring user consent or access delegation.
- **Time-synchronized logs**  
  All systems should use NTP and log timestamps in UTC for correlation.

## Network Security

- **Perimeter Firewalls**  
  Protect external interfaces with strict ingress/egress rules.
- **API Gateway**  
  Terminate TLS, enforce rate limits, and check JWTs and scopes.
- **Service Mesh (e.g., Istio/Linkerd)**  
  Enable mutual TLS (mTLS) between microservices with fine-grained traffic policies.
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**  
  Protect public-facing endpoints from OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDS/IPS)**  
  Monitor and alert on anomalous network activity.

## Data Security

- **Encryption at Rest and in Transit**  
  Use envelope encryption where possible. Vault or cloud KMS for key management.
- **Field-Level Encryption**  
  For highly sensitive fields like Aadhaar numbers, use deterministic or format-preserving encryption.
- **Secure Backups**  
  Backups should be encrypted and tested for recovery.

## Infrastructure Security

- **Secrets Management**  
  Use secrets management tools to issue and rotate secrets dynamically.
- **OS & Container Hardening**  
  Apply CIS Benchmarks. Remove unused packages. Use minimal base images.
- **Runtime Isolation**  
  Use namespaces, seccomp, AppArmor/SELinux, and read-only file systems.
- **Cloud IAM Policies**  
  Enforce least privilege on infrastructure access, using tools like AWS IAM, Azure RBAC, or GCP IAM.

## Technology Patterns

| Domain              | Pattern                     | Description                                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Identity**        | Centralized IAM             | OAuth 2.0 + OIDC via Keycloak for SSO and token issuance      |
| **Authorization**   | Service-specific scopes     | Department-defined fine-grained permissions (`water.apply`)   |
| **Credentialing**   | Decentralized VC issuance   | Issue & verify credentials using OID4VC and DID               |
| **Secret Handling** | Centralized vault           | Secure storage of client secrets, signing keys, tokens        |
| **Audit & Logging** | Centralized logging         | Track logins, API calls, VC issuance and sharing              |
| **Revocation**      | VC status registry          | Implement VC revocation using statusList2021 or registry API  |
| **Network Security**| Gateway + Mesh              | API Gateway (external) + Service Mesh (internal)              |

## Policy & Compliance Considerations

- **Data Localization**  
  Ensure citizen data is stored within the jurisdiction where required.
- **Consent Management**  
  Implement explicit user consent workflows per privacy regulations (e.g., DPDP, GDPR).
- **Breach Notification**  
  Have an incident response plan and legal escalation process for data breaches.

## Summary

> By combining centralized identity (OAuth + OIDC) with decentralized credentials (DID + VC), and surrounding them with strong network, infrastructure, and data protection practices, we enable scalable, secure, and privacy-preserving access to digital public services.
