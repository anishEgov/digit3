# Modular and Evolvable

Designing systems that are both modular and evolvable ensures adaptability to changing requirements, scalability, and maintainability. By adhering to established engineering practices and leveraging appropriate technology patterns and tools, teams can build robust systems that stand the test of time.

## Engineering Practices

- **Develop services as independent, self-contained modules**  
  Each service should encapsulate a specific functionality, promoting reusability and simplifying maintenance.
- **Implement clear versioning and interface contracts**  
  Define explicit interfaces and versioning schemes to ensure backward compatibility and facilitate integration.
- **Utilize containerization and orchestration for deployment flexibility**  
  Employ containers to package services and orchestration tools to manage deployments, scaling, and resilience.
- **Apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
  Ensure that each module or component has one, and only one, reason to change, enhancing clarity and reducing the risk of unintended side effects.
- **Maintain high cohesion and low coupling**  
  Group related functionalities together while minimizing dependencies between modules to enhance flexibility and scalability.
- **Separate concerns effectively**  
  Divide the system into distinct sections, each addressing a specific concern (e.g., user interface, business logic, data access), to improve organization and maintainability.
- **Favor composition over inheritance**  
  Build complex behaviors by composing smaller, reusable components, which enhances flexibility and reusability.
- **Encapsulate implementation details**  
  Hide internal workings behind well-defined interfaces to prevent accidental dependencies and simplify future modifications.
- **Design for change (evolvability)**  
  Follow the Open/Closed Principle, use feature toggles or plugin architectures, and build in versioning and backward compatibility into APIs to accommodate evolving requirements.
- **Apply Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**  
  Align software structure with business concepts using bounded contexts and ubiquitous language, encouraging modular design based on business capabilities.
- **Use layered or hexagonal architectures**  
  Implement architectures that separate concerns into layers (e.g., presentation, application, domain, infrastructure) or isolate the core logic from external concerns like databases and UIs.
- **Practice continuous refactoring**  
  Regularly revisit and refine code to improve structure and readability without changing its external behavior, reducing technical debt over time.
- **Invest in automated testing**  
  Develop unit tests for modules to validate behavior in isolation and integration tests to ensure components work together, supporting refactoring and evolving code with confidence.
- **Utilize package and module management best practices**  
  Organize code into well-defined packages or modules, each with a clear purpose, to enhance reusability and maintainability.
- **Adopt CI/CD and DevOps practices**  
  Automate the building, testing, and deployment processes to facilitate rapid and reliable delivery of changes, encouraging modular delivery (e.g., microservices or independently deployable modules).

## Technology Patterns

- **Microservices architecture**  
  Decompose applications into loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **API Gateway for routing, aggregation, and versioning**  
  Centralize API management to handle request routing, protocol translation, and version control.
- **Service Mesh for inter-service communication and observability**  
  Implement a dedicated infrastructure layer to manage service-to-service communication, providing features like load balancing, encryption, and monitoring.
- **Event-driven architecture**  
  Design systems that respond to events, promoting decoupling and scalability.
- **Plugin architecture**  
  Allow the addition of new functionalities through plugins without modifying the core system, enhancing extensibility.
- **Circuit breaker pattern**  
  Prevent cascading failures in distributed systems by detecting failures and encapsulating the logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring.
- **Strangler pattern**  
  Incrementally refactor a monolithic system by replacing specific pieces with new services.
