# Architecture

## 1. Secure and Privacy-Protective

This section outlines the **end-to-end security architecture**, covering network, data, infrastructure, application, and credential layers to ensure a secure and privacy-respecting environment for citizen-centric service delivery.

### Engineering Practices

#### Identity & Access
- **Adopt a Zero Trust model**  
  Every request must be authenticated and authorized, regardless of origin.
- **Role-based and attribute-based access controls**  
  Enforce least privilege using Keycloak roles and external attribute sources.
- **Use short-lived tokens with rotation**  
  Refresh tokens are rotated and revoked on scope change or logout.

#### Data Protection
- **Encrypt data in transit**  
  TLS 1.2+ is mandatory for all external and internal service traffic.
- **Encrypt data at rest**  
  Sensitive data (tokens, secrets, PII, VCs) is encrypted using AES-256 or stronger.
- **Token and credential hashing**  
  Use industry-standard password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) and key derivation for VCs.

#### Logging & Auditing
- **Audit trails for all key actions**  
  Log authentications, authorization grants, scope approvals, VC issuance & verification.
- **Consent & delegation logging**  
  Record all actions requiring user consent or access delegation.
- **Time-synchronized logs**  
  All systems should use NTP and log timestamps in UTC for correlation.

### Network Security

- **Perimeter Firewalls**  
  Protect external interfaces with strict ingress/egress rules.
- **API Gateway**  
  Terminate TLS, enforce rate limits, and check JWTs and scopes.
- **Service Mesh (e.g., Istio/Linkerd)**  
  Enable mutual TLS (mTLS) between microservices with fine-grained traffic policies.
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**  
  Protect public-facing endpoints from OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDS/IPS)**  
  Monitor and alert on anomalous network activity.

### Data Security

- **Encryption at Rest and in Transit**  
  Use envelope encryption where possible. Vault or cloud KMS for key management.
- **Field-Level Encryption**  
  For highly sensitive fields like Aadhaar numbers, use deterministic or format-preserving encryption.
- **Secure Backups**  
  Backups should be encrypted and tested for recovery.

### Infrastructure Security

- **Secrets Management**  
  Use secrets management tools to issue and rotate secrets dynamically.
- **OS & Container Hardening**  
  Apply CIS Benchmarks. Remove unused packages. Use minimal base images.
- **Runtime Isolation**  
  Use namespaces, seccomp, AppArmor/SELinux, and read-only file systems.
- **Cloud IAM Policies**  
  Enforce least privilege on infrastructure access, using tools like AWS IAM, Azure RBAC, or GCP IAM.
