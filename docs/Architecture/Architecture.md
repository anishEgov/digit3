## Architecture

The journey from individual technology choices to a cohesive Stack Architecture involves strategically combining technology patterns across principles to create functional layers that work together seamlessly. This architectural synthesis follows these key steps:

1. **Pattern Identification**: Technology patterns from each principle are analyzed to identify common themes, complementary capabilities, and potential integration points.

2. **Layered Organization**: Related patterns are organized into logical architectural layers that serve specific functions within the overall system:
   - Foundation Layer (infrastructure, deployment, service architecture)
   - Security Framework (identity, credentials, API protection)
   - Data Layer (persistence, event sourcing, data management)
   - Integration Capabilities (APIs, messaging, data exchange)
   - Resilience Patterns (fault tolerance, scaling, load management)
   - Observability Stack (monitoring, logging, tracing)
   - User Experience Layer (interfaces, accessibility, localization)
   - Extensibility Framework (configuration, plugins, templates)
   - Development Framework (version control, testing, documentation)

3. **Pattern Harmonization**: Potentially conflicting patterns are reconciled to ensure architectural consistency. For example, a centralized IAM pattern from the Security principle must work alongside decentralized credential verification from the Interoperability principle.

4. **Technology Alignment**: Specific technologies are selected for each pattern based on compatibility with other chosen technologies, ensuring they can be integrated into a cohesive stack.

5. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Patterns that affect multiple layers (such as security, observability, and extensibility) are implemented as cross-cutting capabilities that span the entire architecture.

This approach ensures that the Technology Architecture is not simply a collection of individual technologies but a thoughtfully designed system where patterns work together to fulfill all architectural principles simultaneously.

## Comprehensive Technology Architecture

Following this synthesis approach, our Technology Architecture is organized into the following layers and components:

### Foundation Layer
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes for orchestration with Docker containers
- **Service Architecture**: Microservices pattern with Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)
- **Communication**: Event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka
- **Deployment**: CI/CD via GitHub Actions/GitLab CI with public workflows
- **Evolution Strategy**: Strangler pattern for legacy system migration

### Security Framework
- **Identity & Access**: OAuth 2.0 + OIDC with Keycloak for SSO
- **Permission Model**: Service-specific scopes with fine-grained permissions
- **Credential Management**: OID4VC, DID, VC for verifiable credentials
- **Credential Status**: StatusList2021 for VC revocation registry
- **Secrets**: HashiCorp Vault for centralized secret management
- **API Protection**: API Gateway (Kong/Tyk) with WAF capabilities

### Data Layer
- **Persistence**: PostgreSQL (relational) and MongoDB (document)
- **Data Management**: Master Data Management with data governance frameworks
- **Query Pattern**: CQRS to separate read and write operations
- **Event Sourcing**: Store state changes as event sequences
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Data Lineage**: OpenLineage/Apache Atlas for tracking data flow

### Integration Capabilities
- **API Standards**: RESTful APIs and GraphQL with OpenAPI specifications
- **RPC**: gRPC with Protocol Buffers for high-performance communication
- **Data Exchange**: Protocol Buffers/Avro with Schema Registry
- **Messaging**: Kafka for event streams, RabbitMQ for queues
- **Integration**: Apache NiFi for data flow management
- **Data Fusion**: Data integration platforms for analytics

### Resilience Patterns
- **Fault Tolerance**: Circuit breakers (Resilience4j) with bulkhead pattern
- **Scalability**: Autoscaling via Kubernetes/KEDA
- **Load Management**: Load balancing (NGINX/Traefik) with load shedding
- **Health Monitoring**: Service health checks via Consul/Nagios
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations for throughput

### Observability Stack
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus with Grafana dashboards
- **Logging**: ELK Stack or Loki for centralized logging
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry with Jaeger/Zipkin
- **Alerting**: Real-time anomaly detection and notification
- **Business Metrics**: Instrumentation for operational insights
- **Auditing**: Comprehensive audit logging for security events
- **Outcome Reporting**: Dashboards focused on service impacts

### User Experience Layer
- **Frontend**: React/Angular with accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- **Localization**: i18next for multilingual support
- **Multi-Modal**: Support for voice/text/visual interfaces
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensuring basic functionality without advanced features
- **Intelligent Interfaces**: Conversational AI/chatbots
- **Feedback Systems**: Citizen feedback loops for service improvement

### Extensibility Framework
- **Configuration**: Declarative configuration management
- **Plugin System**: Modular plugin architecture
- **Low-Code Options**: For business-user configuration
- **Templates**: Reusable component templates
- **Governance Model**: Meritocratic contribution framework

### Development Framework
- **Version Control**: GitHub/GitLab with InnerSource practices
- **Documentation**: MkDocs/Docusaurus for comprehensive docs
- **Testing**: Automated testing at all levels
- **Performance Testing**: JMeter/Gatling for load testing

This architecture provides a cohesive technology stack that fulfills all our architectural principles while ensuring that components work together seamlessly across all layers of the system.
