DIGIT Registries
Work in Progress
# Objective
The objective of this document is to define the core principles, architecture, and implementation approach for registries within the DIGIT platform, ensuring they serve as authoritative, interoperable, and scalable data repositories. By outlining the essential characteristics, design principles, and challenges of government registries, the document aims to guide the development of a federated and decentralized registry framework that enhances data integrity, service efficiency, and secure information exchange across departments. Additionally, it evaluates different architectural approaches—separate microservices, a common registry service, and a hybrid model—to recommend a scalable and maintainable solution that aligns with government digital transformation objectives.
# Introduction:
Governments manage vast amounts of critical data across various domains, including citizen identities, properties, businesses, and public services. Registries serve as authoritative repositories that ensure accuracy, reliability, and security, acting as a single source of truth for governance. However, many government agencies still operate in data silos, leading to duplication, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies in service delivery. The increasing need for interdepartmental data exchange has made it essential for governments to adopt modern registry frameworks that enable secure, interoperable, and policy-driven information sharing while maintaining department-level autonomy.
A modern registry system must be federated and decentralized, allowing each department to manage its own data while ensuring secure authentication, consent-based data access, and standardized interoperability. By leveraging unique identifiers, scalable architectures, and real-time integration mechanisms, registries can improve data integrity, streamline service delivery, and enhance citizen experiences. As governments embrace digital transformation, efficient, trustworthy, and interconnected registries will become the backbone of transparent and responsive governance.

## Core Characteristics of a Registry Service

A registry should:

### 1. Be Authoritative: Serve as the Source of Truth

- The registry should be the most reliable place for information.
- Other systems or people should trust the registry's data as accurate and up-to-date.

> Imagine you’re checking land ownership. If the property registry says a person owns a piece of land, that should be the final word. There shouldn’t be any confusion or conflicting information elsewhere.

**Example:**  
In a Property Registry, if it shows that "Plot No. 101" belongs to "John Doe," no other system or office should have different information about that property.

- It gets regular updates from verified sources (e.g., property purchases, legal changes).
- Data is validated before being saved, ensuring accuracy.
