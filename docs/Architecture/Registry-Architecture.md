DIGIT Registries
Work in Progress
# Objective
The objective of this document is to define the core principles, architecture, and implementation approach for registries within the DIGIT platform, ensuring they serve as authoritative, interoperable, and scalable data repositories. By outlining the essential characteristics, design principles, and challenges of government registries, the document aims to guide the development of a federated and decentralized registry framework that enhances data integrity, service efficiency, and secure information exchange across departments. Additionally, it evaluates different architectural approaches—separate microservices, a common registry service, and a hybrid model—to recommend a scalable and maintainable solution that aligns with government digital transformation objectives.
# Introduction:
Governments manage vast amounts of critical data across various domains, including citizen identities, properties, businesses, and public services. Registries serve as authoritative repositories that ensure accuracy, reliability, and security, acting as a single source of truth for governance. However, many government agencies still operate in data silos, leading to duplication, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies in service delivery. The increasing need for interdepartmental data exchange has made it essential for governments to adopt modern registry frameworks that enable secure, interoperable, and policy-driven information sharing while maintaining department-level autonomy.
A modern registry system must be federated and decentralized, allowing each department to manage its own data while ensuring secure authentication, consent-based data access, and standardized interoperability. By leveraging unique identifiers, scalable architectures, and real-time integration mechanisms, registries can improve data integrity, streamline service delivery, and enhance citizen experiences. As governments embrace digital transformation, efficient, trustworthy, and interconnected registries will become the backbone of transparent and responsive governance.
# Core Characteristics of a Registry Service
A registry should:
### 1. Be Authoritative: Serve as the Source of Truth
The registry should be the most reliable place for information.
Other systems or people should trust the registry's data as accurate and up-to-date.
Imagine you’re checking land ownership. If the property registry says a person owns a piece of land, that should be the final word. There shouldn’t be any confusion or conflicting information elsewhere.
Example: In a Property Registry, if it shows that "Plot No. 101" belongs to "John Doe," no other system or office should have different information about that property.
It gets regular updates from verified sources (e.g., property purchases, legal changes).
Data is validated before being saved, ensuring accuracy.
### 2. Support CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete
The registry allows users to:
Create new records (e.g., registering a new property).
Read or view existing records.
Update existing information (e.g., changing the owner’s name).
Delete records that are no longer needed (with checks to avoid accidental deletion).
### 3. Provide Search & Query Capabilities
Users should be able to quickly find information by searching for specific details.
Filters can narrow down results (e.g., by location, owner name, status).
Makes it easy to find relevant information without manually browsing through all records.
Example:
In a Water Connection Registry:
A user can search by property address to find water connection details.
A municipality officer can filter connections by status (e.g., active, inactive) to manage maintenance schedules.
The registry uses a search engine or database queries to fetch relevant data.
Results are displayed in an organized list with sorting and filtering options.

### 4. Uniquely Identifiable
Unique Identity ensures that each record in the registry is distinct, just like how fingerprints or national IDs uniquely identify individuals. It involves using two types of identifiers:
Business Unique ID: Specific to the domain and meaningful to users (e.g., Property Number, National ID).
This is a human-readable identifier that is relevant to the domain and ensures uniqueness based on business rules.
For example, a Property ID like “PROP-2025-101” or a National ID for individuals.
Probabilistic Matching - A combination of attributes is used to guarantee uniqueness.
System-Generated UUID: Internally generated for system reference, ensuring global uniqueness.
This is a globally unique identifier generated by the system.
It is used internally for referencing records in the database and APIs.
UUIDs ensure uniqueness even if data is distributed across multiple servers or systems
Benefits of Unique ID
Prevents Duplicate Entries: Ensures no duplicate records, which maintains data integrity.
Accurate Record-Keeping: Avoids confusion, ensuring reliable data retrieval and updates.
Easy Reference: Both business users and systems can refer to records without ambiguity.
ID can also be the address like in a URL  is unique and can also be resolved to the information i.e. the webpage content.
Consistency Across Systems: If data is shared or integrated with other systems, unique identifiers maintain consistency.
Examples:
1. Property Registry Example
Scenario: Registering a property in a city.
Unique Identifiers Used:
Business Unique ID: Property Number (e.g., "PROP-2025-101").
This is meaningful to users, helping them easily identify the property.
It includes the year of registration (2025) and a unique serial number (101).
System-Generated UUID:
Example: 3f50d9b7-e7ba-4e04-a13f-9d3d24b3a5b9
Used internally for database operations and APIs.
When a new property is registered, the system checks the Property Number for uniqueness within that year.
A UUID is also generated, ensuring global uniqueness across all properties.
Even if two properties share the same owner and address, their UUIDs and Property Numbers are different.
2. Individual Registry Example
Scenario: Registering a person in an individual registry.
Unique Identifiers Used:
Business Unique ID: National ID or a combination of attributes.
If National ID is present, it is used (e.g., "A123456789").
If National ID is not present, a combination of attributes ensures uniqueness:
Name + Date of Birth + Place of Birth (e.g., "JohnDoe-1990-01-01-CityXYZ").
System-Generated UUID:
Example: c12e1d48-4f59-4748-b2d9-4d2f4f2c9c9d
Used internally for secure data operations.
If a person provides their National ID, the system checks it against existing records to prevent duplicates.
If no National ID is given, the system verifies uniqueness using the Name + Date of Birth + Place of Birth combination.
A UUID is generated for system reference.
### 5. Traceability
The registry keeps track of:
Who made changes (e.g., user ID).
When the changes were made (timestamp).
What changes were made (before and after values).
Why It’s Important:
Ensures accountability and transparency.
Helps in auditing and resolving disputes.
Example:
In a Trade License Registry:
If a license's validity date is changed, the system logs:
Who changed it (e.g., Admin User).
When it was changed (e.g., Feb 13, 2025, 10:00 AM).
What was changed (e.g., from 2024-12-31 to 2025-12-31).
How It Works:
Changes are recorded in an audit log.
The log is protected from tampering and accessible only to authorized users.

### 6. Interoperability
The registry can communicate and share data with other systems or platforms.
It follows standardized data formats (like JSON, XML) for seamless integration.
Ensures consistency and collaboration between systems (e.g., tax, billing, and legal departments).
Reduces duplication of data entry and errors.
Example:
In a Property Registry:
When a new property is registered, the registry automatically informs the tax system to update property tax details.
It can also send property details to the water connection registry for service activation.
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) enable secure data exchange.
Webhooks or events notify other systems of changes in real time.

### 7. Scalable & Performant
The registry can handle increasing amounts of data and user requests without slowing down.
It is built to accommodate growth, both in terms of storage and user interactions.
Ensures consistent performance even as more users or data are added.
Prevents system crashes during high usage periods (e.g., end-of-year property tax filings).
Example:
In a Water Connection Registry:
It efficiently handles thousands of new connections during a city expansion.
Users can search and view connection details without delays, even during peak hours.
How It Works:
Uses distributed databases to store and manage large datasets.
Load balancers distribute user requests across multiple servers.
Caching mechanisms speed up frequently accessed data.
### 8. Authentication(Record Existence Check)
Allows applications to verify whether a record exists in the registry without exposing sensitive details.
Returns a Yes/No response based on the validity of the provided identifier (e.g., UUID, DID, cryptographic proof). This is returned as a cryptographically signed authentication token (can be JWT, DID Proof or VC).
Supports passwordless authentication, token-based authentication (OAuth2, JWT), DID-based authentication, and OTP verification.
Why It’s Important:
Ensures secure, lightweight verification without revealing private information.
Reduces data redundancy by allowing external systems to confirm existence without data duplication.
Example:
A Property Tax System queries the Property Registry to verify if a property ID exists before generating a tax assessment.
The system exposes an /registry/authenticate API that takes a record identifier and returns either “Yes” (record exists) or “No” (record not found).

### 9. eKYC (Verified Data Retrieval)
Enables applications to request verified data from a registry with explicit consent.
Ensures compliance with security policies, including role-based (RBAC) or attribute-based (ABAC) access control.
Supports Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and cryptographic signatures to guarantee data authenticity.
Facilitates trusted data exchange across federated registries.
Protects sensitive information by ensuring only authorized entities can access verified details.
Reduces reliance on manual verification processes, improving efficiency and security.
Example:
A Banking System queries the Individual Registry to retrieve verified KYC details of a customer before opening an account.
The /registry/ekyc/request API triggers a consent-based verification process.
Once authorization is granted, the /registry/ekyc/data API returns verified details, digitally signed for integrity.

# Key Design Principles For Registries
#### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
#### Focus on Domain Entities: Understand the core entities of the registry (e.g., land parcels for a land registry, assets for an asset registry).
#### Use Bounded Contexts to encapsulate each registry's business logic and ensure separation of concerns.
#### Data Modeling
#### Identify and design schemas for entities.
#### Support hierarchical or relational structures if entities have relationships (e.g., land parcels belonging to a region)
#### Unique Identity Management
#### Assign unique identifiers to every entity. (Nonsystem generated)
#### Use globally unique IDs (e.g., UUID) or domain-specific identifiers (e.g., Land Parcel Number).
#### Data Integrity
#### Enforce data validation rules for accurate and consistent information.
#### Use transactions to ensure consistency during updates.
Traceability & Audit Logs
Maintain immutable records for all changes (e.g., via event sourcing or audit logs).
Track metadata like timestamps, user IDs, and change reasons.
Ability to search history data through API
Security & Access Control
Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
Interoperability & Standards
Use standard data formats like JSON, XML, or CSV for data exchange.
Adhere to domain-specific standards (e.g., ISO 19152 for land registries).
Scalability
Design for scalability to handle growing data and user demand.
Use distributed databases or sharding for large datasets.
APIs and Event-Driven Architecture
Provide REST or GraphQL APIs for CRUD and search operations.
Support event-driven architecture for notifying external systems about changes.
Federated And Loosely Coupled
A registry should be capable of running independently
A registry should have the capability of switching off and switching on the integration on other registries

Configurable



# Key Challenges in Implementing Government Data Registries
Lack of Unique Identifiers for Records: It is difficult to define a unique identifier for a record, and even if one is defined, older records may not have it, or even new records might face inconsistencies.

Example: In an Individual Registry, a mobile number was chosen as a unique identifier, but the Punjab government stated that two citizens could share the same number. Later, a National ID was chosen instead, but when the registry was deployed in Mozambique, it was found that citizens did not have national IDs at all.
Some time government policies does’t allow to capture national id example birth certificate
Soft References Instead of Hard References Across Registries: Registries should enforce hard links to related records, but due to missing legacy data, they often have to rely on soft references.

Example: A Water Connection Registry was designed to require a Land Identification Number, but in Punjab, older land records lacked this information. As a result, the requirement was made optional, leading to inconsistent data.
Non-Validated & Non-Verified Existing Data: Many government registries contain historical, incorrect, or unverified records, making it difficult to ensure accuracy.

Example: In a Property Registry, many plots had incorrect ownership details, missing measurements, or outdated land use information because no validation was enforced at the time of entry. Similarly, Business Registries contained duplicate entries due to different spellings of the same name.
Cost of Verification for Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Registries serve as the single source of truth, but issuing Verifiable Credentials requires expensive manual verification of attributes.

Example: A Property Registry stores information on plot size, construction area, and building type, but to issue a digitally verifiable document, an engineer must physically survey the property. This process is costly and time-consuming, limiting the feasibility of verification for all properties.
Interoperability Between Old & New Systems: Many government registries run on legacy systems that were not designed for integration with modern digital services.

Example: A Vehicle Registry in an Indian state was still operating on a mainframe-based database, making it extremely difficult to integrate with the modern Digital License and Taxation System. Developers had to build custom middleware to bridge the gap.
Security & Privacy Risks: Centralized government registries are high-value targets for cyberattacks, data breaches, and fraud.

Example: A Citizen Registry containing sensitive personal data was breached, exposing millions of names, addresses, and identification numbers. Similarly, officials in some areas have been found tampering with land records to illegally modify ownership details.
Lack of Digital Adoption Among Government Officials & Citizens: Many government employees and citizens prefer traditional paper-based records due to a lack of digital literacy or trust in digital systems.

Example: When a Land Registry was digitized, officials still demanded physical copies of ownership documents for processing, defeating the purpose of the digital transformation. Similarly, in rural areas, citizens often refused to accept digital certificates without an official government stamp.







### Approach 1: Separate Microservices for Each Registry
Each registry (e.g., Property, Trade License, Water Connection) is implemented as a distinct microservice.
Pros:
High Maintainability & Scalability: Independent deployment and scaling per registry.
Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Clear bounded contexts ensure domain logic encapsulation.
Loose Coupling: Services can evolve independently, supporting federated integrations.
Security & Access Control: Fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) per registry.
Performance Optimization: Services can be optimized based on specific data access patterns.
Cons:
Increased Complexity: Multiple codebases and deployment pipelines to maintain.
Higher Infrastructure Costs: Separate deployments require more resources.
Inter-service Communication Overhead: Increased network calls for cross-registry interactions.
Duplication of Common Logic: Common functionalities like auditing, security, and logging may be duplicated.

### Approach 2: Common Registry Service
Create a single, generic registry service capable of managing different registries by storing flexible JSON schemas.
Pros:
Rapid Development: Adding new registries is faster as it involves defining a new JSON schema rather than building a new service.
Reduced Infrastructure Costs: Single deployment for all registries reduces resource utilization.
Consistency & Reuse: Common functionalities like auditing, security, and search are implemented once and reused across all registries.
Flexibility: Easy to adapt to new requirements by updating JSON schemas.
Cons:
Compromised Domain-Driven Design: Difficult to encapsulate domain logic leading to blurred bounded contexts.
Complex Validation & Data Integrity: Implementing complex validation rules for different domains is challenging.
Scalability Issues: A monolithic database structure may face scaling challenges with increasing data volume.
Performance Bottlenecks: Complex queries due to dynamic schemas may impact performance.
Limited Type Safety: JSON schema lacks strict type enforcement, increasing the risk of data inconsistencies.
Single Point of Failure:
If the common registry service has a bug, it affects all registries (e.g., a validation issue in the schema engine could block new records across all registries).
High dependency on this one service; downtime impacts all registry functions.
Complex Codebase & Logic:
The service must support multiple registry schemas, making the code complex.
Schema-driven validation, storage, and query handling add complexity.
Debugging issues can be harder because errors could originate from schema misconfigurations rather than core logic.

### Recommendations:
When to Use Separate Microservices:
If strong domain boundaries, scalability, and maintainability are priorities.
When complex domain logic and data integrity rules are involved.
If federated and loosely coupled integrations are essential.
When to Use a Common Registry Service:
If rapid prototyping or proof of concept is needed.
For registries with simple CRUD operations and minimal business logic.
When infrastructure cost optimization is critical.
Hybrid Approach:
Use a common registry for simple, less critical domains.
Implement separate microservices for complex, business-critical domains.
Implement a shared library/module for common functionalities like auditing, security, and logging.
