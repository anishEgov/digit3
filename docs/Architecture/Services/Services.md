# Service Delivery Architecture

DIGIT's architecture is designed to facilitate the entire service delivery lifecycle, connecting service consumers (citizens, residents, businesses) with service providers (government departments, agencies, and third parties). 

DIGIT's architecture consists of three primary layers that work together to create a seamless public service delivery ecosystem:

## Consumer Layer
This layer provides citizens with a unified service experience through:

- **Consumer**: Registration, profiles, and preference management
- **Channels**: Multi-Lingual and Multi-Modal Channels to discover and access services.
  - Citizen Portal: Web interface for citizens or front line works to access services
  - Mobile App: On-the-go access to services directly or via field force
- **Wallet**: Storage and management of digital credentials and documents
  - Document verification and selective sharing
  - Consent management for data access

## Shared Infrastructure Layer
This layer enables data sharing, reuse, and interoperability:
- **Identity**: 
  - Authentication and authorization for both consumers and providers
  - Plugs into existing Identity Systems if they already exist.
- **Data**: 
  - Registry services for structured data storage
  - Reference data management
  - Document storage and retrieval
  - Store certificates issued by various agencies.
  - Synchronizes data from external data sources.
- **Encryption**: 
  - Key Management
  - Encryption
  - Signing
- **Payment**: 
  - Billing and demand generation
  - Transaction processing and receipt management
  - Integrates with existing payment providers.
- **Notification**: 
  - Multi-channel messaging and alerts
  - Integrate with multiple messaging service providers
- **Data Exchange**: 
  - Asynchronous Service Request/Response routing between consumers and providers.
  - Data Exchange between external systems.
  - APIs, Messaging, Publish Suscribe Events. 

## Provider Layer
This layer empowers government agencies to streamline service delivery:
- **Service Management**:
  - **Provider**: Administration and configuration
  - **Catalog**: Service discovery and metadata
  - **Service Studio**: Low-code/no-code service design tools
- **Service Delivery**:
  - **Service Orchestration**: Request management and form handling
  - **Service Desk**: Assisted access for citizens with limited digital access
  - **Workflow**: Process automation and task management
  - **Employee Workbench**: Case management interface for staff
- **Service Intelligence**:
  - **Analytics**: Performance monitoring and insights
  - **Service Planning**: Demand forecasting and resource optimization
  - **Service Performance**: SLA monitoring and quality management
  - **Administrator Console**: System configuration and management

This layered architecture enables cost-effective transformation at scale by allowing agencies to share infrastructure costs while maintaining control over their service configurations. The multi-tenant design ensures data separation while promoting reuse of common components, standards, and registries across government entities.
