# DIGIT Platform Requirements

## Overview

DIGIT is being built as modular, multi-tenant digital public infrastructure for public service deliver. It provides pluggable identity, account and service management capabilities through a set of backend services (built in Go) and frontend UIs (built in Flutter). It is managed using Docker Compose and consists of following:

- **Frontend Applicaitons**
    - **DIGIT Console**: Account(or Tenant) administration user interface.
    - **DIGIT Studio**: A low code no code Service Design and Management portal for service providers.
    - **DIGIT Citizen**: Unified Interface for Citizens to discover and engage with services.
    - **DIGIT Employee**: Unified Interface for Employees to track and fulfill service requests
    - **DIGIT Administrator**: Unified Interface for Administrators to monitor and plan for Services

- **Backend Services**
    - **Account**: Provides APIs for registration and management of accounts and users of the service provider.
    - **Identity**: Provides OIDC endpoints to authenticate users.
    - **Catalogue**: Enables service providers to register and manage services and enables discovery of services by service consumers.
    - **Registration**: Manages registration and service requests by the service consumers. These could be citizens or other service providers.
    - **Registry**: Manages registry schema and data about the registry.
    - **Workflow**: Manages workflow schema and workflow instances. 
    - **Notification**: Manages notification configuration and notification requests like email, sms, apps etc.
    - **File**: Manages files and provides secure short urls to files.
