# DIGIT

Governments around the world have taken significant steps toward digitizing public service delivery. However, the first phase of this transformation has mostly relied on siloed vertical applications or monolithic ERP systems. While these systems addressed immediate automation needs, they introduced long-term challenges:

- Data is fragmented across multiple systems, often requiring citizens to repeatedly provide the same information.
- Government employees must navigate multiple disconnected tools to serve the public.
- Administrators lack real-time visibility across services, limiting their ability to make informed decisions.
- Evolution and scale are difficult due to rigid architectures and vendor lock-ins.

These problems are widespread—and increasingly, governments are recognizing the need for a new phase of digital transformation.

## What is Public Service Delivery?

Public service delivery refers to the systems and processes through which governments provide essential services to citizens—such as water, sanitation, healthcare, education, civil registration, welfare benefits, and more. These services are fundamental to well-being, equity, and the functioning of society. When delivered effectively, they enhance trust in government, enable inclusive development, and improve quality of life.

However, access to public services is often uneven—especially for marginalized communities—due to fragmented systems, manual processes, and limited transparency. DIGIT is designed to accelerate the transformation of public service delivery, making it more accessible, inclusive, efficient, and citizen-centric. By enabling digital interfaces, shared infrastructure, and interoperable systems, DIGIT helps governments reimagine how services are delivered and how citizens experience them.

## Why DIGIT?

DIGIT is designed to address these systemic issues by providing shared digital infrastructure that enables governments to build citizen-centric services at speed and scale.

It offers a modular suite of backend services and frontend applications that can be composed, extended, and reused across use cases and departments. DIGIT promotes interoperability, data reuse, and trusted data sharing across service providers, enabling governments to move from siloed systems to an integrated digital ecosystem.

## DIGIT in Action

DIGIT is designed from a citizen-centric perspective, reimagining how individuals engage with public services. Whether it's registering a property, applying for a business license, or getting a building plan approved, citizens typically follow a common pattern of interaction with government systems. They start by discovering the service they need, then try to understand the requirements—such as rules, policies, or documents to be submitted. Once ready, they register or log in, fill out the application, upload necessary documents, and make payments if required. Throughout the process, they want to track the status of their application, receive timely notifications, make updates when needed, and eventually download receipts or certificates. After receiving the service, they may provide feedback or raise a complaint if necessary.

To enable this end-to-end experience, DIGIT provides a set of common platform services that are configurable and extensible. These include services for:

- Authentication and User Management
- Registries and Reference Data Management
- Workflow and Process Orchestration
- Notifications
- Document Storage and Encryption
- Boundary

These services are designed to be reused across different use cases, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency.

DIGIT is built as a multi-tenant platform, meaning it can be adopted and operated by multiple agencies—such as ministries, departments, or local governments—within a shared infrastructure. Each tenant can manage its own users, services, and data independently, while still benefiting from common capabilities. 

To make the platform easy to use and configure, DIGIT comes with a suite of frontend applications tailored to different roles:

- **Console**: Managing tenants (or accounts) and user roles
- **Studio**: Low-code/no-code tool for configuring and publishing services
- **Portal**: Unified interface for citizens to discover and access services
- **Workbench**: Interface for government employees to manage and fulfill requests across departments
- **Dashboard**: Helps administrators monitor operations, gain insights, and make data-driven decisions

DIGIT is designed for robustness, reusability, and ease of use, enabling governments to deliver services that are accessible, efficient, and inclusive—at speed and scale.

# Design Principles

Building digital platforms for public service delivery requires more than technical proficiency—it demands a thoughtful approach to sustainability, trust, and impact. These nine foundational design principles are critical for building resilient, inclusive, and scalable public digital infrastructure.

## 1. Modular and Evolvable

Modular design means building systems as small, composable pieces rather than a single monolithic structure. By starting with core functionality and expanding over time, governments can adapt quickly to changing policies, local needs, or citizen demands. This flexibility enables rapid rollout of new services without disrupting existing operations and allows for easy localization across different states or municipalities, reducing duplication of effort and accelerating innovation.

## 2. Single Source of Truth

A single source of truth ensures that data is stored and maintained in a consistent and authoritative manner across the platform. This prevents duplication, contradictions, and inconsistencies—common pain points in public systems where citizen names, property records, or benefit eligibility data are involved. Reliable, centralized data reduces reconciliation efforts, supports seamless service delivery, and builds long-term trust in the government's digital ecosystem.

## 3. Security and Privacy

Public digital systems handle sensitive citizen information—identity data, addresses, financial records, and more. Security and privacy must be built in from the start, through encryption, consent management, access controls, and compliance with legal standards. Breaches not only compromise data but also erode public trust. A privacy-aware architecture ensures ethical and responsible data use, particularly in low-trust environments where maintaining legitimacy is critical.

## 4. Scalable and Performant

Digital platforms must remain stable and responsive even under heavy usage, such as during peak times like tax payment deadlines. Scalability ensures that systems can handle millions of users and records concurrently, while performance optimization keeps response times fast and reliable. Poor performance can cripple essential services and lead to financial or reputational loss. Scalability isn't just about technology—it's about ensuring that no citizen is left behind when demand surges.

## 5. Reliable and Cost Effective

Government systems are mission-critical—downtime can halt vital services like pension disbursals, water supply tracking, or sanitation scheduling. High availability, efficient infrastructure usage, and minimal operational overhead are essential. Public budgets are often constrained; optimizing for cost-effectiveness ensures that more services can be delivered with the same resources. Long-term sustainability also improves when systems reduce dependency on vendors and can be maintained locally.

## 6. Open Source

Open source software ensures that the platform's code is publicly accessible, enabling reuse, collaboration, and transparency. This reduces reliance on proprietary vendors, encourages innovation through community contributions, and allows governments to retain control over their own infrastructure. Transparency in code also allows for audits by external parties, building public confidence in the system's fairness and integrity.

## 7. Interoperable

Interoperability allows systems to work with other digital platforms using standards-based APIs and protocols. Public service delivery frequently spans departments and jurisdictions—seamless data exchange and coordination are crucial. Whether integrating with identity systems (e.g., Aadhaar), GIS tools, or payment gateways, interoperability ensures a cohesive experience for citizens and future-proofs the infrastructure for ongoing evolution.

## 8. Observable and Transparent

Digital systems must provide visibility into how decisions are made. This includes logging, workflows, rules, and real-time analytics. Observability supports audits, improves governance, and helps troubleshoot issues rapidly. More importantly, transparency ensures citizens understand how outcomes—such as subsidy approvals or tax calculations—are determined. It fosters trust and accountability, key pillars of democratic governance.

## 9. Intelligent

Modern digital platforms should go beyond automation—they should actively support data-driven decision-making. Intelligence through analytics and AI allows governments to move from reactive to proactive service delivery. For example, predicting sanitation needs, identifying at-risk households, or optimizing public resource allocation. Intelligent systems don't just make operations more efficient—they improve lives by enabling faster, fairer, and more personalized services.
