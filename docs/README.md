# DIGIT

Governments around the world have taken significant steps toward digitizing public service delivery. However, the first phase of this transformation has mostly relied on siloed vertical applications or monolithic ERP systems. While these systems addressed immediate automation needs, they introduced long-term challenges:

- Data is fragmented across multiple systems, often requiring citizens to repeatedly provide the same information.
- Government employees must navigate multiple disconnected tools to serve the public.
- Administrators lack real-time visibility across services, limiting their ability to make informed decisions.
- Evolution and scale are difficult due to rigid architectures and vendor lock-ins.

These problems are widespread—and increasingly, governments are recognizing the need for a new phase of digital transformation.

## What is Public Service Delivery?

Public service delivery refers to the systems and processes through which governments provide essential services to citizens—such as water, sanitation, healthcare, education, civil registration, welfare benefits, and more. These services are fundamental to well-being, equity, and the functioning of society. When delivered effectively, they enhance trust in government, enable inclusive development, and improve quality of life.

However, access to public services is often uneven—especially for marginalized communities—due to fragmented systems, manual processes, and limited transparency. DIGIT is designed to accelerate the transformation of public service delivery, making it more accessible, inclusive, efficient, and citizen-centric. By enabling digital interfaces, shared infrastructure, and interoperable systems, DIGIT helps governments reimagine how services are delivered and how citizens experience them.

## Why DIGIT?

DIGIT is designed to address these systemic issues by providing shared digital infrastructure that enables governments to build citizen-centric services at speed and scale.

It offers a modular suite of backend services and frontend applications that can be composed, extended, and reused across use cases and departments. DIGIT promotes interoperability, data reuse, and trusted data sharing across service providers, enabling governments to move from siloed systems to an integrated digital ecosystem.

## DIGIT in Action

DIGIT is designed from a citizen-centric perspective, reimagining how individuals engage with public services. Whether it's registering a property, applying for a business license, or getting a building plan approved, citizens typically follow a common pattern of interaction with government systems. They start by discovering the service they need, then try to understand the requirements—such as rules, policies, or documents to be submitted. Once ready, they register or log in, fill out the application, upload necessary documents, and make payments if required. Throughout the process, they want to track the status of their application, receive timely notifications, make updates when needed, and eventually download receipts or certificates. After receiving the service, they may provide feedback or raise a complaint if necessary.

To enable this end-to-end experience, DIGIT provides a set of common platform services that are configurable and extensible. These include services for:

- Authentication and User Management
- Registries and Reference Data Management
- Workflow and Process Orchestration
- Notifications
- Document Storage and Encryption
- Boundary

These services are designed to be reused across different use cases, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency.

DIGIT is built as a multi-tenant platform, meaning it can be adopted and operated by multiple agencies—such as ministries, departments, or local governments—within a shared infrastructure. Each tenant can manage its own users, services, and data independently, while still benefiting from common capabilities. 

To make the platform easy to use and configure, DIGIT comes with a suite of frontend applications tailored to different roles:

- **Console**: Managing tenants (or accounts) and user roles
- **Studio**: Low-code/no-code tool for configuring and publishing services
- **Portal**: Unified interface for citizens to discover and access services
- **Workbench**: Interface for government employees to manage and fulfill requests across departments
- **Dashboard**: Helps administrators monitor operations, gain insights, and make data-driven decisions

DIGIT is designed for robustness, reusability, and ease of use, enabling governments to deliver services that are accessible, efficient, and inclusive—at speed and scale.

## Core Design Principles

DIGIT is built from the ground up with the following principles:

1. **Modular and Evolvable** – Build only what you need, extend easily as requirements grow.
2. **Single Source of Truth** – Consistent, reusable, and reliable data across services.
3. **Security and Privacy** – Designed with strong security and privacy controls.
4. **Scalable and Performant** – Proven to handle large-scale, real-time workloads.
5. **Reliable and Cost Effective** – Supports mission-critical services efficiently.
6. **Open Source** – Community-driven and free from vendor lock-in.
7. **Interoperable** – Standards-based APIs for easy integration across systems.
8. **Observable and Transparent** – Makes rules, workflows, and decisions visible, while emitting real-time data for monitoring and analytics.
9. **Intelligent** – Leverages data, analytics, and AI to enable smarter, proactive public service delivery.
