# DIGIT

Governments around the world have taken significant steps toward digitizing public service delivery. However, the first phase of this transformation has mostly relied on siloed vertical applications or monolithic ERP systems. While these systems addressed immediate automation needs, they introduced long-term challenges:

- Data is fragmented across multiple systems, often requiring citizens to repeatedly provide the same information.
- Government employees must navigate multiple disconnected tools to serve the public.
- Administrators lack real-time visibility across services, limiting their ability to make informed decisions.
- Evolution and scale are difficult due to rigid architectures and vendor lock-ins.

These problems are widespread—and increasingly, governments are recognizing the need for a new phase of digital transformation.

## Why DIGIT?

DIGIT is designed to address these systemic issues by providing shared digital infrastructure that enables governments to build citizen-centric services at speed and scale.

It offers a modular suite of backend services and frontend applications that can be composed, extended, and reused across use cases and departments. DIGIT promotes interoperability, data reuse, and trusted data sharing across service providers, enabling governments to move from siloed systems to an integrated digital ecosystem.

## Core Design Principles

DIGIT is built from the ground up with the following principles:

1. **Modular and Evolvable** – Build only what you need, extend easily as requirements grow.
2. **Single Source of Truth** – Consistent, reusable, and reliable data across services.
3. **Security and Privacy** – Designed with strong security and privacy controls.
4. **Scalable and Performant** – Proven to handle large-scale, real-time workloads.
5. **Reliable and Cost Effective** – Supports mission-critical services efficiently.
6. **Open Source** – Community-driven and free from vendor lock-in.
7. **Interoperable** – Standards-based APIs for easy integration across systems.
8. **Observable and Transparent** – Makes rules, workflows, and decisions visible, while emitting real-time data for monitoring and analytics.
9. **Intelligent** – Leverages data, analytics, and AI to enable smarter, proactive public service delivery.
