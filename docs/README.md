## DIGIT

Governments around the world have made significant strides in digitising public service delivery. However, most early systems were siloed vertical applications or monolithic ERP implementations. While they addressed immediate needs, they introduced long-term challenges:

- Fragmented data requiring citizens to repeatedly provide the same information
- Disconnected tools forcing government employees to navigate multiple systems
- Lack of real-time visibility for administrators to monitor service delivery
- Rigid, unscalable architectures with high vendor lock-in

DIGIT represents a new phase of digital transformation—one that is modular, interoperable, and citizen-centric. It enables governments to build inclusive, accessible, and accountable digital infrastructure for public service delivery.

### What is Public Service Delivery?

Public service delivery encompasses the systems and processes through which governments provide essential services to citizens—such as water, sanitation, healthcare, education, welfare, and civil registration. When delivered effectively, these services improve well-being, equity, and public trust.

However, access is often uneven—especially for marginalised communities—due to manual processes, fragmented systems, and limited transparency. DIGIT helps governments modernise these processes through shared infrastructure, digital workflows, and citizen-friendly interfaces.

### Why DIGIT?

DIGIT enables governments to:

- Deliver services through a common infrastructure, reducing duplication
- Reuse data and processes across departments
- Support inclusive service access in multiple languages and formats
- Monitor operations in real-time and make data-driven decisions

Its suite of backend services and frontend applications are modular, configurable, and extensible—allowing local customisation while preserving platform consistency.

### DIGIT in Action

DIGIT supports a full-service lifecycle—from discovery to fulfilment. Citizens can discover services, understand eligibility, submit applications, track status, receive notifications, and provide feedback—all through digital interfaces.

To support this, DIGIT provides reusable services for:

- Authentication and User Management
- Registries and Reference Data
- Workflow and Process Management
- Notifications and Communication
- Document Management
- Service Configuration

Its frontend applications include:

- **Console**: Administer tenants and users
- **Studio**: Configure services with low-code/no-code tools
- **Portal**: Help citizens discover and access services
- **Workbench**: Assist employees in fulfilling requests
- **Dashboard**: Enable administrators to monitor and analyse data

DIGIT is designed to make public service delivery more accessible, efficient, and inclusive.

## Design Principles

### 1. Security and Privacy

Ensure that all citizen data is handled securely and respectfully. Build in encryption, access controls, and consent management. Prevent data misuse through auditability and responsible data handling.

### 2. Single Source of Truth

Avoid data duplication and contradictions by establishing authoritative registries and event-driven data sharing. Enable reliable, consistent decision-making across services.

### 3. Reliable and Cost-Effective

Design for high availability, graceful degradation, and infrastructure efficiency. Reduce downtime risks while optimising for public sector budgets.

### 4. Scalable and Performant

Ensure services remain fast and responsive under increasing load. Use stateless components, asynchronous processing, and distributed design.

### 5. User-Centered and Inclusive

Design for diverse users—citizens, employees, vendors, and administrators. Support local languages, accessibility, and multi-modal interaction including voice. Respect privacy and support low-literacy and low-connectivity use cases.

### 6. Observable and Transparent

Enable audits, real-time monitoring, and citizen visibility into service processes. Publish logs, events, and metrics to promote accountability and trust.

### 7. Interoperable

Support open APIs, common data formats, and event standards to enable systems to work together. Promote ecosystem collaboration over vendor lock-in.

### 8. Open Source

Foster transparency, auditability, and community contribution through open licensing. Allow governments to inspect, adapt, and extend software freely.

### 9. Modular and Evolvable

Structure the platform as a set of independent, composable services. Enable independent upgrades, localisation, and extension without disrupting the whole system.

### 10. Configuration-First and Extensible

Empower business users to define services without writing code. Use declarative, low-code approaches with options for technical extension through plugins and APIs.

### 11. Intelligent

Leverage data and AI to support personalisation, prediction, and decision support. Use analytics to improve policy, target delivery, and proactively detect service issues using GIS, IoT, and other signals.
