# Principles

This document outlines the key architectural principles that guide the design and implementation of our systems. Each principle have been detailed out into practices used to implement the principle and also technology patterns that enable implementation of the practice. 

1. [Secure and Privacy-Protective](Secure-and-Privacy-Protective.md)  
   Ensuring end-to-end security and privacy protection across all layers of the system.

2. [Single Source of Truth](Single-Source-of-Truth.md)  
   Establishing consistent and authoritative data sources across the organization.

3. [Reliable and Cost Effective](Reliable-and-Cost-Effective.md)  
   Ensuring continuous availability while optimizing resource utilization.

4. [Scalable and Performant](Scalable-and-Performant.md)  
   Building systems that can handle increasing loads while maintaining optimal performance.

5. [User-Centered and Inclusive](User-Centered-and-Inclusive.md)  
   Designing for diverse users with support for local languages, accessibility, and multi-modal interaction.

6. [Observable and Transparent](Observable-and-Transparent.md)
