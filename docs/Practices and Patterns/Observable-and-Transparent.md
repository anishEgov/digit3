# Observable and Transparent

For public service platforms, observability and transparency are paramount to ensure accountability, monitor service-level agreements (SLAs), and facilitate continuous improvement. By focusing on business-centric metrics, organizations can align operational performance with citizen expectations and policy objectives.

## Engineering Practices

- **Define and Monitor Business-Centric KPIs**  
  Establish clear key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflect service quality, efficiency, and citizen satisfaction. Examples include:
  - Service Fulfillment Rate: Percentage of services delivered within the promised timeframe.
  - Citizen Satisfaction Score: Aggregated feedback from service recipients.
  - First-Time Resolution Rate: Proportion of services resolved without repeat requests.
- **Implement Real-Time Dashboards**  
  Develop dashboards that provide stakeholders with up-to-date insights into service performance, enabling timely interventions.
- **Ensure Data Transparency**  
  Publish performance data in accessible formats to foster trust and allow public scrutiny.
- **Conduct Regular Audits and Reviews**  
  Periodically assess service delivery processes and outcomes to identify areas for improvement and ensure compliance with standards.

## Technology Patterns

- **Business Metrics Instrumentation**  
  Integrate tools that capture and analyze business-related data points, such as service completion times and user feedback.
- **Citizen Feedback Loops**  
  Establish mechanisms for collecting and responding to citizen input, ensuring services evolve based on user needs.
- **Outcome-Based Reporting**  
  Focus on reporting actual service outcomes and impacts rather than just process metrics, aligning with results-based management principles.
