# Open Source

Embracing open source principles fosters transparency, collaboration, and innovation. By adopting open standards, contributing to community-driven projects, and leveraging open-source tools, organizations can build robust, scalable, and cost-effective solutions.

## Engineering Practices

- **Adopt and Contribute to Open Standards and Tools**  
  Engage with existing open-source projects and standards to avoid reinventing the wheel and to benefit from community expertise.
- **Maintain Public Issue Tracking and Documentation**  
  Use public platforms for issue tracking and documentation to encourage community participation and transparency.
- **Encourage External Contributions with Clear Guidelines**  
  Provide comprehensive contribution guidelines, including coding standards and review processes, to facilitate external contributions.
- **Implement a Code of Conduct**  
  Establish a code of conduct to create an inclusive and respectful environment for all contributors.
- **Regularly Engage with the Community**  
  Participate in discussions, respond to issues, and acknowledge contributions to build a vibrant community.

## Technology Patterns

- **Distributed Collaboration and Governance**  
  Adopt governance models that distribute decision-making authority, such as meritocratic or liberal contribution models, to empower contributors.
- **Public CI/CD Workflows**  
  Implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines that are publicly accessible to ensure transparency and encourage community involvement.
- **InnerSource Practices**  
  Apply open-source development methodologies within the organization to improve collaboration and code quality.
- **Modular Architecture**  
  Design systems with modular components to facilitate independent development and integration by different contributors.
