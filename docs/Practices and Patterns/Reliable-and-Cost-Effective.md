# Reliable and Cost Effective

Building systems that are both reliable and cost-effective ensures continuous availability and optimal resource utilization. Implementing robust engineering practices, adopting proven architectural patterns, and leveraging open-source technologies are key to achieving these objectives.

## Engineering Practices

- **Design for Graceful Degradation**  
  Ensure that the system continues to operate in a reduced capacity when parts of it fail, maintaining core functionalities and providing a better user experience during outages.
- **Implement Circuit Breakers and Retry Mechanisms**  
  Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures and retries to handle transient faults, enhancing system resilience.
- **Use Autoscaling and Resource-Efficient Workloads**  
  Implement autoscaling to adjust resources based on demand and design workloads to be resource-efficient, reducing operational costs.
- **Employ Load Shedding Techniques**  
  Prioritize critical requests and shed non-essential load during high traffic periods to maintain system stability.
- **Implement Health Checks and Monitoring**  
  Regularly monitor system components and perform health checks to detect and address issues proactively.
- **Optimize Resource Allocation**  
  Continuously analyze and adjust resource allocation to ensure efficient utilization and cost savings.

## Technology Patterns

- **Fault Tolerance**  
  Design systems to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components.
- **Circuit Breakers**  
  Prevent a network or service failure from cascading to other services by stopping the flow of requests when a service is detected to be failing.
- **Observability and Monitoring**  
  Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability to gain insights into system performance and detect anomalies.
- **Autoscaling**  
  Automatically adjust the number of active servers or resources based on current demand to optimize performance and cost.
- **Load Shedding**  
  Gracefully degrade service by dropping less critical requests when the system is overloaded.
- **Health Checks**  
  Regularly verify that services are operating correctly and are available to handle requests.
