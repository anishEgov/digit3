# Single Source of Truth

Establishing a Single Source of Truth (SSOT) ensures that all systems within an organization reference consistent and authoritative data. This approach minimizes data discrepancies, enhances decision-making, and streamlines operations across distributed architectures.

## Engineering Practices

- **Centralize Core Registries and Master Data**  
  Implement dedicated services or databases to manage critical entities such as users, products, or locations, ensuring a single authoritative source for each.
- **Implement Schema Validation and Synchronization**  
  Define and enforce data schemas across services to maintain consistency, and establish synchronization mechanisms to propagate changes reliably.
- **Use Event Sourcing to Track Data Changes Across Services**  
  Record all changes as a sequence of immutable events, allowing reconstruction of current state and providing a complete audit trail.
- **Adopt Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**  
  Separate read and write operations to optimize performance and scalability, especially in complex domains.
- **Establish Data Governance Policies**  
  Define clear ownership, stewardship, and quality standards for data to ensure accountability and compliance.
- **Implement Data Lineage and Auditing Mechanisms**  
  Track the origin and transformation of data throughout its lifecycle to facilitate debugging and regulatory compliance.
- **Ensure Consistent Data Synchronization Across Systems**  
  Develop robust integration strategies to keep data consistent across various platforms and services.

## Technology Patterns

- **Master Data Management (MDM)**  
  Utilize MDM practices to maintain consistent and accurate master data across the organization, serving as the backbone for SSOT.
- **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**  
  Design systems where components communicate through events, promoting loose coupling and real-time data propagation.
- **Event Sourcing**  
  Store state changes as a sequence of events, enabling precise state reconstruction and facilitating complex business logic.
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**  
  Implement CQRS to handle complex domains by separating read and write operations, improving scalability and maintainability.
- **Data Lineage Tracking**  
  Incorporate tools and practices that trace data flow from origin to consumption, ensuring transparency and aiding in compliance efforts.
- **Data Governance Frameworks**  
  Establish frameworks that define data ownership, quality standards, and access controls to maintain data integrity and security.
