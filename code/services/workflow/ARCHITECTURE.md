# Workflow Service Architecture

## 1. Overview

The Workflow Service is a Go-based microservice responsible for defining and managing stateful, multi-step processes. It allows for the creation of process definitions (workflows), tracking of individual process instances as they move through states, and enforcement of business rules (guards) at each transition. The service is built to be multi-tenant, RESTful, and easily configurable for different environments.

## 2. Layered Architecture

The service follows a clean, layered architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
